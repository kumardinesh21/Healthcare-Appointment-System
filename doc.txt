1. Microservices Setup:
Discovery Service (Eureka Server):

Central registry for all services.
Helps in service discovery and load balancing.
API Gateway:

Acts as a reverse proxy to handle requests from clients.
Implement rate limiting, security, and route requests to microservices.
Config Server (optional):

Central configuration management for all services.
2. Service 1: User Service:
Role: Manages users (patients and doctors).
Endpoints:
POST /register: Register patient/doctor.
POST /login: Login and return JWT token.
Security: JWT authentication with role-based access control.
Database:
Use MySQL + JPA for storing user details (name, role, contact).
User roles: ADMIN, DOCTOR, PATIENT.
Entities:
User: id, name, email, role, password.
Doctor: specialization, availability.
3. Service 2: Appointment Service:
Role: Manages appointments between patients and doctors.
Endpoints:
POST /appointments: Book an appointment.
GET /appointments/{id}: Get appointment details.
PUT /appointments/cancel: Cancel an appointment.
Database:
MySQL + JPA for appointment information.
Entities:
Appointment: id, patient_id, doctor_id, date, time, status.
Inter-Service Communication:
Use Feign Client to fetch doctor and patient details from the User Service.
4. Service 3: Medical Record Service:
Role: Manages patient medical records.
Endpoints:
POST /records: Upload a new medical record (prescriptions, history).
GET /records/{patientId}: Retrieve all records for a patient.
Database:
MongoDB to store unstructured data like prescriptions, test results.
Entities:
MedicalRecord: id, patient_id, doctor_id, record_type, file (prescription, lab reports).
5. Service 4: Notification Service:
Role: Sends notifications (email/SMS) for appointment reminders or prescription uploads.
Endpoints:
POST /notify: Send email/SMS notification.
Messaging: Use RabbitMQ or Kafka for sending appointment updates.
External Integration: Integrate Twilio/SendGrid for email or SMS services.
6. Service Communication:
Feign Clients for inter-service communication.
Use Eureka Discovery for locating services.
7. Security:
Spring Security with JWT tokens.
Implement Role-Based Access Control:
Patients can access their records and appointments.
Doctors can access patient medical records and manage appointments.
8. Database Setup:
MySQL for structured data (Users, Appointments).
MongoDB for unstructured data (Medical Records).
9. Deployment:
Use Docker for containerization of services.
Deploy using Kubernetes (optional for scaling).
Implement Spring Boot Actuator for monitoring.
